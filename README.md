This is a basic Movie Applicaiton built with React.Js and styled with CSS. It shows movies from "The Movie Database API" linked below.

https://www.themoviedb.org/

Basic Components included Movie cards which display a movie poster, title, rating, and upon hover shows an overview of the movie. Movies are based on popularity from the live database website. My application also includes a button location on the bottom right which when pressed takes you to the top of the page. A search bar that finds movies based on you input and a page navigation on the bottom of the page.
